# Project Name

Match Prediction of English Premier League Using Betting odds and Match Statistics

## Overview

The project will address key factors such as predicting who is going to be the match winner based on betting statistics and team statistics. Our aim is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict who is going to win the match based on the above-mentioned statistics. 

## Installation

Run the code in Pycharm. I have added a Jupiter notebook aswell, Please do install the required packages/libraries.

## Usage

Run the app 1.py file to get a localhost running with a html page where I have deployed the model.
## Data

The Premier League match statistics were sourced from (https://www.football-data.co.uk/).

## Models

Multiple machine learning algorithms are employed to predict match outcomes:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
